#Beer-O-Clock
5PM... What is their to say? The time that we all count down until, the time we dream of, the time we ditch our suits and ties and partake in the drink of the gods, BEER!  Yes, if you are a simple office drone and 5PM is that glorious time you can forget your day in that beverage made by the tears of angels, this app may just help you get their a little easier.
